Be Secure!
==========

UC Berkeley security policy mandates that all devices connected to the UC Berkeley network comply with our Minimum Security Standard for Networked Devices (MSSND). Meeting our MSSND helps protect not only you, but everyone on campus networks. We ask that for the safety of all UC Berkeley students and staff that you meet the following requirements.

Anti-Virus Software
-------------------

### By installing anti-virus software you give yourself a fighting chance against malicious programs trying to gain access to your computer.

To check if you have anti-virus installed already, follow this step:
<!-- Image goes here -->
<!-- Maybe a side-by-side comparison. Left side is where to check on Windows (click the taskbar as shown in mockup). Right side is where to look on Mac (Top-right?) -->

If you do not have anti-virus installed, we recommend you download [Avast Free!](http://www.avast.com) _(For Windows and Mac)_

<!-- The mockup has the Avast logo here with a button that says Get Avast! Might not be a bad idea. -->

Active Firewall
---------------

### Ensuring that your computer's firewall is enabled prevents dangerous network traffic from exploiting software vulnerabilities.

Not sure if your firewall is on? Follow these steps:
<!-- Literally stolen from a Microsoft help article -->
  * *Windows*
    * Open Windows Firewall by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type firewall, and then click Windows Firewall.
    * In the left pane, click Turn Windows Firewall on or off. Administrator permission required If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
    * Click Turn on Windows Firewall under each network location that you want to help protect, and then click OK.
  * *Mac*
    * Open System Preferences and click on Security & Privacy.
    * Travel to the Firewall tab and click Turn On Firewall.

Strong Password
---------------

### Most security compromises today happen in part to weak user-credentials. Make sure that your passwords are strong and hard to guess!

Here are some tips on creating strong passwords:
  * Have a length of eight characters *or more*
  * Use numbers or special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*()_+|~-=\`{}[]:";'<>?,./)
  * Consider using phrases or acronyms to make them easier to remember!

Automatic Updates
-----------------

### Hackers are finding ways to subvert software everyday. Keep your system up to date to stay ahead of them!

Do you have automatic updates enabled? Follow these steps:
  * *Windows*
    * Open Windows Update by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type update, and then click Windows Update.
    * In the left pane, click Change Settings.
    * Select an option that best fits your needs.
  * *Mac*
    * Open System Preferences and click on App Store.
    * Check Automatically Check for Updates and Install System Data Files and Security Updates

Up-To-Date Operating System
---------------------------

### By updating to modern operating systems like OS X Mavericks and Windows 7/8, you receive patches that help keep your system secure!

If you are running an end-of-life operating system (Windows XP or Snow Leopard), click [here](https://software.berkeley.edu/MS-DL-instructions) to be sent to UC Berkeley's Software Central. These instructions will help you install a more modern operating system. This service is offered *for free* for all UC Berkeley students and staff.

Modern Web Browser
------------------

### Using a modern internet browser provides you greater protection against web-based attacks!

If you do not already have it, we recommend you download [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox).
